# **Retail-Sales-Prediction**

## **Problem Description**

Rossmann operates over 3,000 drug stores in 7 European countries. Currently, Rossmann store managers are tasked with predicting their daily sales for up to six weeks in advance. Store sales are influenced by many factors, including promotions, competition, school and state holidays, seasonality, and locality. With thousands of individual managers predicting sales based on their unique circumstances, the accuracy of results can be quite varied.

The task is to forecast the "Sales" column for the test set. And some stores in the dataset were temporarily closed for refurbishment.

## **Methodology**

At first handling all the null values and cleaning the data set for Exploratory Data Analysis.
I am performing the sales forecast primarily through two methods:
Regression: Linear Regression and Random Forest Regression.


## **Conclusion:**

Here I tried to extract a better model from the given dataset and made a well-accurate model by using a linear regression technique. And Achieved RMSE(82%), Ridge(93%), and Lasso(93%).
