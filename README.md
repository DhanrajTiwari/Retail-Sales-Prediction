# Retail-Sales-Prediction

Problem Description

Rossmann operates over 3,000 drug stores in 7 European countries. Currently, Rossmann store managers are tasked with predicting their daily sales for up to six weeks in advance. Store sales are influenced by many factors, including promotions, competition, school and state holidays, seasonality, and locality. With thousands of individual managers predicting sales based on their unique circumstances, the accuracy of results can be quite varied.

The task is to forecast the "Sales" column for the test set. And some stores in the dataset were temporarily closed for refurbishment.

Data Description

Rossmann Stores Data.csv - historical data including Sales

store.csv - supplemental information about the stores

Data fields

Most of the fields are self-explanatory. The following are descriptions for those that aren't.

Id - an Id that represents a (Store, Date) duple within the test set

Store - a unique Id for each store

Sales - the turnover for any given day (this is what you are predicting)

Customers - the number of customers on a given day

Open - an indicator for whether the store was open: 0 = closed, 1 = open

StateHoliday - indicates a state holiday. Normally all stores, with few exceptions, are closed on state holidays. Note that all schools are closed on public holidays 
and weekends. a = public holiday, b = Easter holiday, c = Christmas, 0 = None

SchoolHoliday - indicates if the (Store, Date) was affected by the closure of public schools

StoreType - differentiates between 4 different store models: a, b, c, d

Assortment - describes an assortment level: a = basic, b = extra, c = extended

CompetitionDistance - distance in meters to the nearest competitor store

CompetitionOpenSince[Month/Year] - gives the approximate year and month of the time the nearest competitor was opened

Promo - indicates whether a store is running a promo on that day




Here we tried to extract a better model from our given dataset and made a well accurate model by using linear regression technique .
